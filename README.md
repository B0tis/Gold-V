## How to Add Mods, and New Resources

This quickstart repository for Typescript allows mods.

However, **do not put your resources in the `resources` folder**.

Instead you should put resources, mods, etc. in the `src` folder in their own folder. They will be automatically copied to the `resources` folder after the code is transpiled.
